# Contextual Engineering

A comprehensive library of curated rulesets for Cursor and Windsurf AI coding frameworks. This repository organizes community-agreed and official guidelines into thematic categories such as web development, data science, AI workflows, game development, security, and version control. Designed for seamless integration into AI-assisted coding sessions, it enhances productivity with structured, reliable rules for various domains. Includes detailed reports and documentation to support developers in leveraging AI tools effectively.

## Structure

- **`/cursor_rules/`**: Rulesets for Cursor AI framework, organized into subdirectories like `general`, `web_development`, `data_science`, `ai_workflows`, `game_development`, `security`, and `version_control`.
- **`/windsurf_rules/`**: Rulesets for Windsurf AI framework (Cascade engine), structured into categories such as `web_development`, `mobile_development`, `data_science`, `game_development`, `security`, and `version_control`.
- **`cursor_windsurf_rules_report.md`**: A comprehensive report listing all rulesets with justifications, evaluations, and source links.

## Usage

To use these rulesets, copy the desired `.mdc` files (for Cursor) or `.md` files (for Windsurf) into the appropriate rules directory in your project (e.g., `.cursor/rules/` or `.windsurf/rules/`). This allows the AI to apply the guidelines during coding sessions. Refer to the individual READMEs in `/cursor_rules/` and `/windsurf_rules/` for more details on specific ruleset organization.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have new rulesets or improvements to existing ones, please submit a pull request. Ensure that new rulesets are well-documented with sources and justifications.
