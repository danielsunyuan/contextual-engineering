# Cursor Rulesets Library

This directory contains curated rulesets for Cursor AI coding framework. Each ruleset is stored in a separate `.mdc` file with a descriptive name to guide the AI agent in specific tasks or coding styles.

## Organization

Rulesets are organized into thematic subdirectories for clarity and ease of access:

- **general**: General coding style and formatting rules.
- **web_development**: Rules related to web frameworks and styling (e.g., Next.js, UI Styling).
- **data_science**: Guidelines for data science and MLOps projects.
- **ai_workflows**: Rules for AI-driven workflows (e.g., LangGraph, Autonomous Workflow).
- **game_development**: Rules tailored for video game development.
- **security**: Security-focused coding practices.
- **version_control**: Best practices for Git and version control.

## Usage
Place these rules in `.cursor/rules/` within your project root to apply them automatically or manually as needed.

## Rulesets
- Each file is a specific ruleset with metadata and instructions for the Cursor agent.
- Rulesets are sourced from official documentation, community contributions, and industry best practices.
