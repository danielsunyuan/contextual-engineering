# Autonomous Workflow Rules
- Maintain two core files for project context:
  - 'project_config.md': Define project goals, tech stack, coding patterns, and limitations.
  - 'workflow_state.md': Track current state (Analyze, Blueprint, Construct, Validate), plan steps, embedded rules, and AI logs.
- Use these files to guide the AI in a Devin-like autonomous coding experience.
- Ensure AI updates 'workflow_state.md' dynamically during tasks.
