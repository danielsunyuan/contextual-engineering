# Windsurf Rulesets Library

This directory contains curated rulesets for Windsurf AI coding framework (Cascade engine). Each ruleset is stored in a separate `.md` file with a descriptive name to guide the AI agent in specific tasks or coding styles.

## Organization

Rulesets are organized into thematic subdirectories for clarity and ease of access:

- **general**: General coding guidelines (currently empty, reserved for future rules).
- **web_development**: Rules for web development standards (e.g., TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).
- **data_science**: Guidelines for data science and MLOps tasks.
- **mobile_development**: Rules specific to mobile app development (e.g., React Native).
- **game_development**: Rules tailored for video game AI prompting.
- **security**: Security-focused coding practices.
- **version_control**: Best practices for Git commit guidelines.

## Usage
Place these rules in `.windsurf/rules/` within your project root to apply them as needed.

## Rulesets
- Each file is a specific ruleset with instructions for the Windsurf agent.
- Rulesets are sourced from official documentation, community contributions, and industry best practices.
