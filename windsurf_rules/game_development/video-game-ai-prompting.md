# Video Game AI Prompting Rules for Windsurf

- Structure prompts clearly for game development tasks, specifying 'what' and 'how'.
- Layer prompts to mirror game architecture (e.g., UI, game logic, backend systems).
- Use the Windsurf editor to organize files into logical folders (e.g., /frontend, /backend).
- Lock critical game files to prevent overwriting during regeneration.
- Request AI suggestions for game features like responsive UI or gameplay mechanics.
