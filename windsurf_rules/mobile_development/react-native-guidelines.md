# React Native Guidelines for Windsurf

- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring projects.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and useWindowDimensions.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles.
