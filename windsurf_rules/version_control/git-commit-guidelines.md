# Git Commit Guidelines for Windsurf

- Automate commit message generation using AI tools like GitHub Copilot or GitLens, but always review for clarity and intent.
- Structure commit messages with a clear subject line (limited to 50 characters) and a detailed body if needed.
- Customize AI-generated commit messages to fit team standards (e.g., use all lowercase, follow Conventional Commits, add footers).
- Commit changes frequently but logically, ensuring each commit represents a single, meaningful update.
- Use Windsurf's integrated terminal to run Git commands like 'git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"' for versioning.
- Leverage Windsurf's Memories to persist Git workflow preferences and rules for consistent behavior.
- Provide context to AI when drafting commit messages by highlighting relevant code changes or project goals.
