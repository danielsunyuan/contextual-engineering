# TypeScript Coding Standards for Windsurf

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Avoid using 'any'. Create necessary types instead.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.
- Use PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables/functions/methods, kebab-case for file/directory names.
- Keep functions short and single-purpose (<20 lines).
- Use early returns and extract logic into utility functions to avoid nested blocks.
- Prefer immutability for data using 'readonly' and 'as const'.
